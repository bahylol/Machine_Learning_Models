# Machine_Learning_Models
These two files contain two learning models. In the first model, called "IMDB," I used supervised algorithms like Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors to predict a movie's gross earnings. I based these predictions on attributes such as IMDB Rating, Release Year, Runtime, and Meta Score. Additionally, I performed data cleaning and visualization as part of the process.

The second model, "Spending Behavior," focuses on understanding the relationship between annual income and spending score. For this model, I used the unsupervised K-Means Clustering algorithm. Again, data cleaning and visualization were integral steps in the analysis.
